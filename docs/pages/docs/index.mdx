# Introduction

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused
websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create
Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start

import { Cards } from 'nextra/components'

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    image
    arrow
    title="Documentation theme"
    href="/docs/docs-theme/start"
  >
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow
the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

## Nextra FAQ

The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions).

export function FAQBox({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <details
      open
      className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2 mt-4"
    >
      <summary>
        <strong className="text-lg">{title}</strong>
      </summary>
      <div className="p-2">{children}</div>
    </details>
  )
}

<FAQBox title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
  No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
  the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
  `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other
  routes in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
  There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
  [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
  add live coding components to your MDX.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
 */

const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export', // from NextJs v13.3.0 next export is depricated
  images: {
    unoptimized: true // mandatory, otherwise won't export
  }
  //Optional: Change the output directory `out` -> `dist`
  //  distDir: "build"
}
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx'
})
module.exports = withNextra(nextConfig) //export the congifg as a dependency
```

By default, static export will be stored in `out` directory in the root of your
project.
